  The goal is to create a simple animated sketch book, a bit like a flip
  book for the web. People of all ages can have fun creating fun and 
  simple animations.

  Currently I have added in the basic drawing capability and the tool
  display graphical overlay. There is no application structure at this
  point.

  What is still needed:

  * The tool menu:
    * Line width as a slider adjusts the width variable
    * Line colour,
    * Eraser
  * The animation menu:
    * Select frame
    * Add frame
    * Copy frame
    * Delete frame
    * Play / stop
    * Repeat
  * The saved animations menu:
    * Create new animation
    * Search animations
    * Delete animation
